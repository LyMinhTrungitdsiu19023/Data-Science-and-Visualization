Overview 
Our project researched and visualized the infection of Covid pandemic after 1 years. We collect data from the internet through reputable websites. The purpose is to enumerate the number of infected and fatalities in the past 1 year. We will apply Data Visualization to make it easier for users to understand those figures by graphing representation.
We will visualize the current global scenario of Covid-19 using line charts and bar chars. Then we will visualize how Covid deaths vary with respect to age group and how various pre-existing medical conditions vary with age. Then we will visualize and analyze how various medical conditions contribute to Covid death. We will also compare the performance of the world against Codvid.
